          <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630. He was born at Shivneri which is a hill fort in Junnar in Poona, now known as Pune. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took birth into a family of bureaucrats. His father Shahji Bhonsale was a great Maratha general in the army of Bijapur Sultanate and his mother Jijabai was a great devotee of religion. He was the founder of the great Maratha kingdom of India. He was one of the bravest and marvelous rulers in the 17th century.</p><br>
          <p>In the annals of Indian history, the name Shivaji Maharaj stands as a beacon of courage, wisdom, and resilience. A leader par excellence, he carved out a kingdom that echoed the spirit of the people it embraced. </p>
     
     <br>     <p>
          Cha.Shivaji's military prowess was legendary, but it was not merely about conquest. It was about safeguarding the rights and dignity of his people. His innovative guerrilla warfare tactics showcased not just strategic brilliance but a deep understanding of the terrain and the pulse of his subjects. </p>
     
     <br>
     <p>Beyond the battlefield, Shivaji was a statesman who believed in justice and religious tolerance. He built a realm where people of all faiths could coexist harmoniously, fostering an environment of unity and diversity that was ahead of its time.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Cha.Shivaji's administrative reforms reflected his progressive vision. He established a system that upheld meritocracy and encouraged local self-governance, ensuring that the benefits of governance reached the grassroots.</p>
     <br>
